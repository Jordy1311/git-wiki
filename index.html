    <p>
      Git is officially defined as a distributed version control system (VCS).<br><br>In other words, it's a system that tracks changes to project files over time. It enables the user to record project changes and go back to a specific version of the tracked files at any given point in time.  This system can be used by many people to efficiently work together and collaborate on team projects, where each person can have their own version of the project distributed on their computer. Later on, these individual versions of the project can be merged and adapted into the main version of the project. This aims to increase speed of development while maintaining all files' integrity.<br><br>Git was created in 2005 by Finnish-American software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">Linus Torvalds</a>, with contributions from other kernel developers, for the development of the Linux kernel. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer of Git.<br><br> Based on the read-me file included with the source code of Git, the name can mean:

      <li>nothing, just a random three-letter conbination that is pronouncable.</li>

  <section id="design" class="container">
    <h3>Design Characteristics</h3>
    <p>Git's design was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper" target="_blank">BitKeeper</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_(software)" target="_blank">Monotone</a> - alternative VSCs. It was originally designed as a low-level version-control system engine, on top of which others could write front ends, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_(software)" target="_blank">Cogito</a>.</p>
    <h5>Strong support for non-linear development:</h5>
    <p>Git supports branching and merging and includes specific tools for visualising and navigating change history. A core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers.</p>
    <h5>Distributed development:</h5>
    <p>Git gives each developer a local copy of the full change history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.</p>
    <h5>Compatibility with existent systems:</h5>
    <p>Repositories can be published via HTTP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a>), FTP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">File Transfer Protocol</a>) or a Git protocol over either a plain socket or ssh (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol" target="_blank">Secure Shell Protocol</a>) which means files are highly compatible.</p>
    <h5>Efficient handling of large projects:</h5>
    <p>Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable, and performance tests done by Mozilla showed that it was an order of magnitude faster than some version-control systems; fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.</p>
    <h5>Cryptographic authentication of history:</h5>
    <p>The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a <i>"commit"</i> in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed.</p>

    <h3>How it works:</h3>
    <p class="mb-2">Projects are stored in repositories, which is just a container for project files with a few extra text files that are responsible for keeping track changes.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">There are two types of repositories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-2"><b>Local repository</b> - this is one that is stored on one's own device and is generally linked to a remote. Any changes that are made to files stored on a local repository will not automatically reflect on the linked remote repository. This creates a development environment where users can make changes without having worry that their changes will negatively impact stable files which are stored on the remote. Likewise, changes that are made to the remote are not automatically reflected on one's own local repository, therefore, the remote needs to be <i>"pulled"</i> which updates the local to the same state as remote.</li>
      <li class="mb-4"><b>Remote repository</b> - this is one that is stored on a server and is generally accessable to many people. In a project which involves many people, changes to these files should, in theory, only happen after someone has submitted the changes for review and they have been approved and merged. This is the aspect of Git that ensures integrity of files by making sure no one is responsible for changes.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="d-flex">
      <div id="workings-description">  
        <h5 id="main-heading">Main/Master:</h5>
        <p>This is the set of files located on the remote or the files that are pulled off of the remote. If you are collborating with other developers and wanting to make changes or additions to the directory, you wouldn't usually make these changes or additions directly to the main/master as it means they will have no opportunity for review, instead you would make changes on another branch.</p>
        <h5 id="pulling-heading">Pulling</h5>
        <p>Is the act of updating your local repository with the remote repository.</p>
        <h5 id="branches-heading">Branches and Checking-out:</h5>
        <p>A <b>branch</b> can be seen as an individual timeline of the project. With Git, you can create mutiple branches that allow you to add new (experimental, unfinished and/or potentially buggy) features in a seperate environment which can be submitted to others for review. Another member of a team could also create another branch off your branch in order to build on your ideas which adds a lot of thickness and complexity. Users can only be on one branch at a time. Switching branches will update your local repository from the files on the current branch to the files on the new branch. The act of changing branches is called <i>"<b>checking out</b> **branch-x**"</i>.</p>
        <h5 id="tracked-heading">Tracked/Untracked Changes:</h5>
        <p><b>Tracked</b> changes are to files that were originally on the main/master branch. <b>Untracked</b> changes are files that are new to the project that Git has no record of.</p>
        <h5 id="staging-heading">Staging & Commits:</h5>
        <p>The staging area is an imaginary somewhere you can put changes before commiting them. This allows you to commit multiple changes that are related which helps clarify & classify a lot of work. <b>Staging</b> is the act of putting a change into this area. <b>Committing</b> is the act of recording a snapshot of the code as a whole (including changes that were staged).</p>
        <h5 id="pull-heading">Pull requests:</h5>
        <p>Note: this is different to pulling! <b>Pull requests</b> are a function of Github (a Git repository hosting service) that opens a ticket which details commits, files within those commits and differences (diffs) of those files if they were tracked, for the use of peer review. It allows one to request review of and communicate about changes that have been made.</p>
        <h5 id="merges-heading">Merges:</h5>
        <p>Once changes have been reviewed and approved by reviewers, <b>merging</b> is the next step. It takes the branch and combines it with main, making sure that any conflicts (places where code on both of the brances are different) are addressed. In simple cases, Github is able to deal with conflicts automatically, however, in more complex cases a <i>"merge-conflict"</i> may occur which will require user review to ensure code from both branches works as intended.</p>

    <h5>Rebase:</h5>
    <p>What rebasing is is a good question</p>
