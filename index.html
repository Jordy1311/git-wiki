    <p>
      Git is officially defined as a distributed version control system (VCS).<br><br>In other words, it's a system that tracks changes to project files over time. It enables the user to record project changes and go back to a specific version of the tracked files at any given point in time.  This system can be used by many people to efficiently work together and collaborate on team projects, where each person can have their own version of the project distributed on their computer. Later on, these individual versions of the project can be merged and adapted into the main version of the project. This aims to increase speed of development while maintaining all files' integrity.<br><br>Git was created in 2005 by Finnish-American software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">Linus Torvalds</a>, with contributions from other kernel developers, for the development of the Linux kernel. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer of Git.<br><br> Based on the read-me file included with the source code of Git, the name can mean:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>nothing, just a random three-letter conbination that is pronouncable.</li>
      <li>stupid. contempible and despicable. simple. From the dictonary of slang.</li>
      <li>"global information tracker".</li>
      <li>"goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="design" class="container">
    <h3>Design Characteristics</h3>
    <p>Git's design was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper" target="_blank">BitKeeper</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_(software)" target="_blank">Monotone</a> - alternative VSCs. It was originally designed as a low-level version-control system engine, on top of which others could write front ends, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_(software)" target="_blank">Cogito</a>.</p>
    <h5>Strong support for non-linear development:</h5>
    <p>Git supports branching and merging and includes specific tools for visualising and navigating change history. A core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers.</p>
    <h5>Distributed development:</h5>
    <p>Git gives each developer a local copy of the full change history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.</p>
    <h5>Compatibility with existent systems:</h5>
    <p>Repositories can be published via HTTP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a>), FTP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">File Transfer Protocol</a>) or a Git protocol over either a plain socket or ssh (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol" target="_blank">Secure Shell Protocol</a>) which means files are highly compatible.</p>
    <h5>Efficient handling of large projects:</h5>
    <p>Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable, and performance tests done by Mozilla showed that it was an order of magnitude faster than some version-control systems; fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.</p>
    <h5>Cryptographic authentication of history:</h5>
    <p>The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a <i>"commit"</i> in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed.</p>

    <h3>How it works:</h3>
      <h5 id="main-heading">Main/Master:</h5>
      <p>This is the core directory including the files with changes that have been agreed upon. If you are collborating with other developers and wanting to make changes or additions to the directory, you wouldn't usually make these changes or additions directly to the main/master as it means they will have no opportunity for review.</p>
      <h5 id="branches-heading">Branches and Checking-out:</h5>
      <p>This is what a branch is and what making one means. Checking out is what you do when you effectivley "jump" onto the created branch</p>
      <h5 id="tracked-heading">Tracked/Untracked Changes:</h5>
      <p>This is what tracked and untracked changes are</p>
      <h5 id="commits-heading">Commits:</h5>
      <p>This is what a commit is</p>
      <h5 id="push-heading">Push requests:</h5>
      <p>This is what a push request is and what happens at this stage</p>
      <h5 id="merges-heading">Merges:</h5>
      <p>This is what a merge is</p>

      <p>Diagram that highlights sections when titles <-- are hovered over. Should be able to use css to make those sections highlight? Otherwise .js would be totally fine</p>

  <section id="additional" class="container">
    <h3>Additional actions:</h3>
    <h5>Merge conflicts:</h5>
    <p>Merge conflicts are intimidating things but if you take your time with them they shouldn't be too bad!</p>
    <h5>Rebase:</h5>
    <p>What rebasing is is a good question</p>
    <h5>Stashing:</h5>
    <p>Stashing is saving some unstaged changes for a little later</p>
    <h5>Log:</h5>

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Git - Is the name of the software describe above.</li>
      <li>Repository - A remote directory that stores files managed by Git.</li>
      <li>Master/Main - Is the main branch that stores all merged branches/initial files.</li>
      <li>Branch - User created copy of master/main that allows the user to make changes without changing master/main.</li>
      <li>Checkout - The act of changing where your changes will effect</li>
      <li>Tracked/Untracked - Tracked changes are changes that are made to files already on master/main. Untracted are new files</li>
      <li>Commit - Is made at user-defined stages to "save" changes to the branch/master/main.</li>
      <li>Push request (PR) - When you have finished making changes on a branch and want to merge this back into master/main you will create a push request to submit to a reviewer.</li>
      <li>Merge - The act of consolidating a branch with master/main.</li>
      <li>Merge Conflict - Where changes conflict with another branch/master/main.</li>
      <li>Rebase - ???</li>
      <li>Stash - Temporarily storing changes while you make changes elsewhere.</li>
